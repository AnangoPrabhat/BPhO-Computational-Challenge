# BPhO-Computational-Challenge
The [BPhO Computational Challenge](https://www.bpho.org.uk/bpho/computational-challenge/), run by the British Physics Olympiad, is a competition for solving physics problems computationally. In 2025, the topic is optics. 

This project consists of our solution to the BPhO Computational Challenge 2025 Optics Tasks. We have developed a website (/Website) to show our solutions for the tasks interactively, and a vision demonstration (/vision_project) website containing an interactive simulation of the eye's lens and an eye test game.

We also created an app for each of the websites, which can currently be downloaded using the APK files in /APKs. To install these APKs, you must enable "Install from unknown sources" in your Android settings. This setting can expose your device to security risks. We guarantee that the provided APKs are built directly from the source code in this repository and contain no malicious code, however, for maximum security, use the websites.

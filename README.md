# BPhO-Computational-Challenge

This project consists of our solution to the BPhO Computational Challenge 2025 Optics Tasks. We have developed a website (\Website) to show our solutions for the tasks interactively, and a vision demonstration (\vision_simulator) website containing an interactive simulation of the eye's lens and an eye test game.

We also created an app for each of the websites, which can be downloaded using the APK files

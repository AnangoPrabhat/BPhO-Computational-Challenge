# BPhO-Computational-Challenge

This project consists of our solution to the BPhO Computational Challenge 2025 Optics Tasks. We have developed a website (\Website) to show our solutions for the tasks interactively, and a vision demonstration (\vision_simulator) website containing an interactive simulation of the eye's lens and an eye test game.
